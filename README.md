# Loom

Loom is what one day might become my simple, small, personal go-to PHP library/framework. For now it is nothing but work-in-progress, and not meant to be used by anyone.

## Background

I used to work for one of the dinosaur Internet companies for many years, and spent many nights and weekends writing the PHP framework upon which I created internal tools and websites.

When I left the company, my PHP library/framework stayed behind. I could of course start using Zend Framework 2, Phalcon, or similar, but I guess half the fun is in writing the library itself.

So who knows if Loom will ever be anything more than a dream of what I once implemented and wish I could recreate from memory.

## Status

Currently I'm just touching some files, outlining classes, and not really implementing much. I will outline more classes, write tests, and implement code as I feel like it, but I have no schedules or plans.

It will be done when it is done.
