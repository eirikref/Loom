Loom is what one day might become my simple, small, personal go-to PHP
library. For now it is nothing but work-in-progress, and not really
meant to be used by anyone else.


## Background

I used to work for one of the dinosaur Internet companies for many
years, and spent many nights and weekends writing a PHP library upon
which I created several internal tools and websites.

When I left the company, my PHP library had to stay behind. I could of
course then start using Zend Framework 2, Phalcon, or another
high-quality, well-tested, and feature-ready framework. But no. I'm
not even going to pretend that writing Loom is about creating
something of actual value to the world ("Look, it's... oh, just
another PHP framework."). Writing Loom is a therapeutic exercise, just
trying to deal with the constant feeling of emptiness after leaving so
many years of code behind.

Maybe Loom will never be more than a dream of what I once implemented
and once had.


## Status

Currently I'm just touching some files, outlining classes, and not
really implementing much. I will outline more classes, write tests,
and implement code as I feel like it, but I have no schedule and no
specific plans.

It will be done when it is done.
